# monteCarloPi
This project used C++, CUDA, and Monte Carlo method to calculate Pi
A Monte Carlo Simulation is a way of approximating the value of a function where calculating the actual value is difficult or impossible.

It uses random sampling to define constraints on the value and then makes a sort of "best guess."
Compare processing speed by using CPU(serial) and GPU(parallel)
By parallelizing the serial version of the algorithm, we can see an immediate improvement of performance.
